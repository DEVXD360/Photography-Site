# Photography Site
I love to click mostly the natural ones or the ones that gives me a perfect satisfaction of where I am in. 
Photography allows you to create images of special events, times, and places. 
It lets you record the specifics of an event – and it also allows you to share that event with friends and family, long after it's done and gone.
I made this site to showcase my pictures that i took.

## The Project
